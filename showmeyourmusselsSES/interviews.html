  "What does the company you work for do? <br>
We are a privately-owned environmental consulting company.  So, we work for a very wide-range of clients including public (states, federal [defense, USEPA, USFWS, USBLM, etc.], cities,), non-government agencies (non-profits, home owner associations), utilities, manufacturing companies, mining,  architecture and engineering (A&E) companies, other environmental companies, transportation including shipping, airports roadways and rail… Energy – coal, natural gas, wind power, solar power, private individuals, real estate developers, whew….  Just about everyone..<br>
 

What is your specific job title and what do you do on the job?<br>
Vice President / Aquatic Ecologist.  I used to do almost nothing but fieldwork, diving, report writing, and keeping up with research conferences and events.  In the last 3 years I now do more company management, proposal development, website content and marketing.  Maybe the reason you found us in a search?<br>
 

What got you interested in working with mussels?<br>
Dr. Marty Huehner was my college advisor at Hiram College.  I worked w/ him for two years as an undergrad doing mussel surveys on the Grand River in NE Ohio.  Later on when I was hired at EnviroScience as a fisheries biologist I started going after mussel survey work and we got our first surveys in PA.  Eventually we started doing work in more places and hiring in more mussel specialists and Dr. Huehner worked for us part time and eventually fulltime. <br>
 

Where do you mostly study mussels?<br>
The Midwest is the bulk of our work but we have experience all over the U.S.  I’ve done most of my work in PA, OH, FL and WV, and some work in MN, IL, IA, KY, MI, AL, GA, AR.<br>
 

What do you believe are the biggest factors that lead to the declining population of mussels?<br>
Habitat loss:
                                                               i.      Loss / modification of small tributaries affects water quality / quantity downstream<br>

                                                             ii.      Channel / floodplain modification<br>

                                                           iii.      Dredging<br>

                                                           iv.      Dams<br>

Blocking fish hosts<br>
Changing fish communities<br>
Creating sedimentation / erosion downstream > headcuts<br>
Water quality / quantity<br>
                                                               i.      Changes in land cover<br>

                                                             ii.      Water quality modification from dams / impervious surface<br>

                                                           iii.      Mining / acid mine drainage / sedimentation<br>

                                                           iv.      Water withdrawals – for agriculture and for industrial / fracking<br>

                                                             v.      Non-point / agriculture<br>

Pesticides – based on my limited qualitative observations, I believe something is depressing freshwater mussel reproduction / juvenile survival in the Midwest streams not related to habitat but may be heavy metals or pesticides, or the surfactants in pesticides.
                                                           vi.      Stormwater

Invasive species
                                                               i.      Zebra / quagga mussels

                                                             ii.      Corbicula spp.

                                                           iii.      Black Carp (emerging threat) especially in the Mississippi:  https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=573

 

How can people be more proactive in protecting mussels and their habitat?
Plan ahead for projects that affect water resources.
                                                               i.      Complete presence / absence surveys ahead of time to allow for mussel distributions to be completed at the preliminary design stage of projects

                                                             ii.      Complete alternative analysis of your project designs at the preliminary design stage

Protect water resources:
                                                               i.      Encourage natural stream design / dam removals where appropriate

                                                             ii.      Look at efficiency for water use at agricultural, industrial and private scales

 

Are there different threats to mussels in different parts of the country? (Mouth of river vs source, north or south, etc.)
Yes.  You could look at any of the above list and the order of threats changes relative to your location in the country:
                                                               i.      Water withdrawals

Southeast (Apalachicola Basin), West
                                                             ii.      Invasive species

Zebra Mussels
Eastern U.S.
Black Carp
Mississippi River
                                                           iii.      Dam effects

Very large effects in areas of the southeast due to temperature, DO changes, number and depth of dams, etc."
