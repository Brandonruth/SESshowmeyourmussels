<p>Freshwater Mussels play an important ecological role in aquatic environments and are considered to be "ecosystem engineers." They modify aquatic habitat, making it more suitable for themselves and other organisms.
One of the valuable functions they perform is capturing organic matter from the water column when they siphon, processing it to build body and shell, outputting nutrients that are immediately available to plant life that need it, then depositing the leftover organic material to the sediment making it available for more animals to consume. During this feeding process, the mussels remove phytoplankton and the bacteria and fungi that are attached to the non living organic particles they remove from the water column. Other undesirable particles and chemicals are bound in the mussels' pseudo feces and deposited on the river bottom.
The musselsâ€™ shells provide an important substrate for algae and insect larvae to attach to, giving them a habitat to build off of. When mussels are present in large numbers, they may become underwater gardens that in turn attract fish to feed, including their host fish, making the area more biodiverse. Because mussels firmly anchor themselves to the lake or stream bed, they may actually stabilize the lake or stream bottom, thus minimizing the scouring effects of floods and wave action, which helps us when rains become stronger or snow melt is insane one year.
Mussels are also an important food source for several different kinds of terrestrial and aquatic animals, including muskrats and raccoons, as well several species of fish. If they disappear, so do all of the animals that rely on them for a food source.
