<p>Freshwater mussels have always proved to by a key part of their environment, acting as food, filters, and homes to organisms like algae and insect larvae. Large groups of mussels can form a sort of underwater garden as they provide solid contact points for many different species to latch onto, this in turn often attracts many fish which feed on any organisms that call the mussels shell home. This is a mutually beneficial relationship for the mussel as it will eventually attract one of the fish to use for reproduction. Mussels also filter organic material out of the water, consuming it and filtering out important nutrients for many aquatic plants.This process also can remove some harmful chemicals from the water, as the mussel does not re release the chemical back into the water.<p/>
