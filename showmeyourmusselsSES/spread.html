<p>Males release sperm, into the water that are drawn in by the females. The fertilized eggs are brooded in the female's gills (in illustration: 3), where they develop into tiny larvae called glochidia  . The glochidia are then released by the female mussels and attach to fish gills (in illustration: 4) or skin as temporary parasites.evolved elaborate methods to lure fish to the pregnant females. Females display and actively move their mantle lures to attract the host. When a fish strikes the lure, glochidia are released and attach to the fish.<p/>
