<p>Males release sperm, into the water that are drawn in by the females. The fertilized eggs are embedded in the female's gills where they mature into tiny larvae called glochidia  . The glochidia are then released by the female mussels and attach to fish gills or skin as temporary parasites. They evolved complex methods to lure fish to the pregnant females. Females display and vigorously move their mantle lures to attract the host. When a fish strikes the lure, glochidia are released and attach to the fish.<p/>
