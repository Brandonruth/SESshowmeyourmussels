<br><p> Dams disconnect river connections which decreases the amount of fish spreading the freshwater mussels spermicide along the river which helps the muscles with their pop0ulation.  Also stream channelization or ditching is another threat to the freshwater mussels. It is guessed that over 2000 miles of natural rivers and streams have been ditched in Minnesota's portion of the Red River Basin alone. Stream dredging wetland drainage and field tiling that leads to rapid water runoff, bank erosion, and streambed destabilization, commercial harvesting has made it illegal for this to happen in certain areas in Minnesota along the Mississippi River and along the edge of Wisconsin. If you do want to harvest, a special permit is required. Last but not least, the Zebra mussel . The zebra mussel, or the Dreissena polymorpha, was brought over from somewhere in Europe by attaching to their ships in clusters. Now that they are in our lakes and rivers, they are suffocating the native mussels that we have by attaching themselves to the freshwater mussels in such big clusters that they are dying from suffocation, starvation, and an inability to move properly.
