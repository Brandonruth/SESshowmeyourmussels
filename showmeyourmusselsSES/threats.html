<br><p> Dams that fragment river connections and form silt-laden impoundments 
ams not only alter the natural flow of rivers, but they also block the movement of fish hosts, and turn free flowing streams into a series of lakes or pools, making the survival of mussels that are adapted to a riverine environment difficult or impossible. Stream channelization or ditching, It is estimated that over 2000 miles of natural rivers have been channelized in Minnesota's portion of the Red River Basin alone. Stream dredging wetland drainage and field tiling that leads to rapid water runoff, bank erosion, and streambed destabilization, commercial harvesting has the state of Minnesota not allow the harvesting of mussels from inland waters and allows only limited commercial harvest of a single species of mussel from the Mississippi River along the border with Wisconsin. A special permit is required to legally harvest mussels from this portion of the Mississippi River.water pollution. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, brought from Europe into the Great Lakes in the late 1980s in the ballast water of ships, affect native mussels by attaching in large numbers to any exposed area of the native mussel's shell, eventually causing death due to suffocation, starvation, interference with movement, and increased vulnerability to parasitism.
