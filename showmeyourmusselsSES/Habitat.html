 Mussels spend their lives partially buried in river and lake bottoms, where they can be mistaken for rocks. Most people mistake them for other many different kinds of animals that live under the water of our lakes and streams. Freshwater mussels inhabit lakes and rivers throughout the world. They reach their greatest populations in North America, where about 300 species are found. They often live in communities where there are an abundance of different species of mussels called mussel beds. These beds can support 30 or more species.
