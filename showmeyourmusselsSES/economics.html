<p>The economic importance of the freshwater mussel cannot be understated, especially in a water recreational state like minnesota. Mussels, in large groups, that the ability to filter out massive amounts of algae, fungi, and even some harmful chemicals from the lake or river water, bettering the body of water for not only itself, but also us and every other organism that calls it home. With the loss of these mussels we have seen a drastic drop in the health of many bodies of water in minnesota, except in areas where large mussel populations are still present. If we allow these mussels to go extinct or even simply leave them where they are now, our lakes and streams may never recover fully, if at all. That will mean a near end to many forms of water recreation for a majority of our bodies of water, which could mean the death of one of minnesota's largest industries.<p/>
